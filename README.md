# tejaswini

This is a personal flutter project I created to help small businesses keep track of their employees
This app can be used to know the employees work status and location,


An employer can use the admin app to assign new task and view their location 
an employees can dismiss a task assigned to him after a task is done 


Will be adding more features in the near future,

feel free to provide feedback.
